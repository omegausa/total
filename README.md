# Trivium of Theorems and Lemmas

This repository provides a list of theorems which we explicitly allow to be
quoted on the American Masters in Math.
It functions more like a Scrabble dictionary
and we anti-recommend using it as a study reference.

Contributions to the TOTAL
(equivalently, requests to allow citing a certain result)
from the general public are welcome.
They should take the form of GitHub pull requests;
see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
