# Contributing guidelines

If your favorite theorem is missing form the TOTAL,
you can request its inclusion by submitting a
[pull request](https://github.com/omegausa/total/pulls).
We ask that pull requests adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Please check whether the theorem is already included in the textbooks
   mentioned under "Blanket Statements".
   If so, there is no need to submit another pull request for it.
2. All submissions must follow Evan Chen's
   [LaTeX style guidelines](https://web.evanchen.cc/latex-style-guide.html).
   Requests that don't do so will not be processed.
3. We may ask for evidence that a proposed addition
   could plausibly be ever relevant to a competition-like problem.
